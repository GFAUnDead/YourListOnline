Getting Started
To get started with this code, you will need to create a SQL database and use the following code to build the tables:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT(11) PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    username VARCHAR(50) COLLATE latin1_swedish_ci,
    password VARCHAR(255) COLLATE latin1_swedish_ci,
    api_key VARCHAR(255) COLLATE latin1_swedish_ci,
    is_admin TINYINT(1) DEFAULT 0,
    signup_date DATETIME,
    last_login DATETIME
);

CREATE TABLE todos (
    id INT(11) PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    user_id INT(11),
    objective TEXT COLLATE latin1_swedish_ci,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    completed TINYTEXT COLLATE latin1_swedish_ci
);
```

The todos table has the following columns:

id: a unique identifier for the todo item
user_id: the id of the user who owns the todo item
objective: the text of the todo item
created_at: the timestamp when the todo item was created
updated_at: the timestamp when the todo item was last updated
completed: a flag indicating whether the todo item has been completed or not

Note that id is set to INT with the AUTO_INCREMENT option, which will automatically generate a unique identifier for each new todo item added to the table. user_id and objective are set to INT and TEXT data types, respectively. created_at and updated_at are set to TIMESTAMP data type to store the date and time values, and completed is set to TINYTEXT data type to store a flag that indicates whether the todo item has been completed or not.
